# Google Merchant Center (GMC) Setup Guide

## 1. What is Google Merchant Center?
Google Merchant Center is a tool that helps you upload your store and product data to Google and make it available for Shopping ads and other Google services. 

For **VOOM**, this is the bridge between your website and the "Shopping" tab on Google Search results.

## 2. Why is this needed? (The Importance)
*   **Visual Search Results**: Unlike regular text SEO, GMC allows your products to appear with **Images, Prices, and Ratings** at the very top of Google.
*   **Trust & Authority**: Seeing a product in the "Shopping" section makes the brand look official and premium.
*   **Free Organic Listings**: Google provides free listings in the "Shopping" tab for verified merchants.
*   **Foundation for SEM**: You cannot run Google Shopping Ads (the most effective ads for e-commerce) without a GMC account.

    *   **title**: (e.g., VOOM Premium Car Shampoo - 100ml)
    *   **description**: (Use the SEO description we wrote)
    *   **link**: (The URL to the product page)
    *   **image_link**: (The URL to the product photo)
    *   **price**: (e.g., 499.00 INR)
    *   **availability**: (in_stock)
    *   **condition**: (new)

### Step 5: Activate "Free Listings"

## 4. Maintenance Tip
*   **Keep Prices Synced**: If you change the price on the website, you **must** update the Google Sheet immediately. If the prices don't match, Google will suspend the account.
*   **Check Diagnostics**: Visit the **"Diagnostics"** tab once a week to ensure there are no "Disapproved" products.
