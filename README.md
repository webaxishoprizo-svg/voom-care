# VOOM | Premium Car Care Storefront

VOOM is a high-fidelity, production-ready storefront designed for a luxury automotive fragrance brand. This project is built using a modern stack (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and is deeply integrated with the Shopify eco-system.

## 🚀 Deployment & Post-Build Setup

To ensure the storefront is fully operational, the following manual steps **must** be completed in your hosting environment (Vercel) and the codebase.

### 1. Vercel Environment Variables
You must add the following environment variables in your Vercel Dashboard (`Settings > Environment Variables`) for the serverless functions and Shopify integration to work:

| Variable | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SHOP` | Your Shopify store domain (e.g., `checkout.voomcare.com`) | Shopify Admin |
| `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` | Shopify Admin API Access Token | Shopify App Settings |
| `PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN` | Your public domain (e.g., `voomcare.com`) | Domain Provider |
| `PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Shopify Storefront API Token | Shopify App Settings |

### 2. Meta Pixel Update
The Meta Pixel is currently initialized with a placeholder ID. To use your own:
1.  Open `index.html` and search for `827163549102837`. Replace it with your actual **Meta Pixel ID**.
2.  Open `src/lib/meta-pixel.ts` and update the `PIXEL_ID` constant at the top of the file.

### 3. Serverless Functions
The newsletter subscription logic is handled by `/api/newsletter.js`.
*   Ensure your Vercel project is configured to look for the `/api` directory.
*   The `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` mentioned above is critical for this function to securely add subscribers to your Shopify Customers list.

## 🛠 Features

*   **Hybrid Product Engine**: Blends high-performance local data with real-time Shopify inventory and pricing.

## 💻 Local Development
